The Crew is a board game by KOSMOS. It is a trick taking game which consists of a deck of 40 cards.
There are four main colors/suits: pink, yellow, blue, green. Each color/suit has nine cards numbered 1-9.
In addition to these cards, there are four cards of the trump suit (black) which are numbered 1-4. All cards
    are dealt evenly amongst players.
Unlike euchre or 5-3-2, this trick taking game is cooperative. Before the first trick is played but after cards are dealt, players
must choose objectives which they must complete in order to "pass" that level. Objectives are given a difficulty which varies based
on the number of players, but is always between 1-6. Whoever is dealt the black 4 ("right bower") is the start player
and will lay down the lead the first trick as well as choose their objective first. Similar to any trick taking game, you can only
"sluff" (play a card of a diffirent suit than what was lead) if you have no cards of the lead suit. I will omit the black 1 for 
three player games
